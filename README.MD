# 🍅🐍 Pythondoro - Another pomodoro app
Simple, minimal, small timer with always on top function  
Lovely made ❤ with [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/)

## 🔧 Installation  

Open your terminal, navigate to **Pythondoro** folder and run this command

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎨 Usage

- Start `main.pyw`
- Right click on the window to access the `settings`
    - `Pomodoro lenght`: time of productivity (in minutes)
    - `Pause lenght`: time of productivity (in minutes)
    - `Auto start pomodoro`: Auto start pomodoro after pause
    - `Auto start pause`: Auto start pause after pomodoro

- Access the headless, always on top, window clicking `On top` button
    - Grab it anywhere and move it around
    - Right click and `Enlarge` to go back to the normal window


## 📝 Very important note  

Always on top function works only if you don't enter fullscreen apps.  
Notably, videogames enter fullscreen. Consider changing the video settings of your game from fullscreen to boarderless window/boarderless fullscreen.  
If not available, run this [Boarderless-Gaming](https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases) and change your game settings to windowed, adjusting the resolution to match your screen
